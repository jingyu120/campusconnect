                  This course focuses on applying object-oriented techniques in
                  the design, development, and integration of server-side
                  enterprise applications using technologies such as servlets,
                  Java Server Pages, and JDBC. Topics include web applications,
                  multi-tier architecture, model-view-controller architecture,
                  database connectivity, and security.

                  This course is designed for the software engineering
                  professional to gain a greater understanding of the key
                  ingredients in creating and/or managing a successful testing
                  program to meet project needs. Topics covered include test
                  lifecycle planning, test design & coverage analysis,
                  complexity, levels of testing such as unit, integration,
                  system, performance and stress testing. Best practice
                  strategies in software testing such as verification &
                  validation, early lifecycle testing, risk based testing and
                  automation will also be examined including exposure to test
                  automation methods and tools.
